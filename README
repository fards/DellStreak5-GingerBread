This is a kernel for the Dell Streak 5 based on Alpha Code released by Dell at opensource.dell.com subsequently removed without explanation. 


The kernel builds and boots and is stable enough for everyday use but there are several issues with it in its current state, that need workarounds or fixing. 

The Initial Commit is NOT how the code came, 
there are several codefixes, tweaks and experiments already enabled. 


****THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS**** and will be updated regularily

======================================

CURRENT ISSUES

PowerManager is having issues with wakelock (it won't recover from idle)

work around is to echo 1 > sys/power/wake_lock


Sensors dont work at userspace level 
the kernel uses "Sensors_daemon" a mid layer that messes with the HAL. 
At low level the sensors work

voice is picked up by mic on first call after boot, but does otherwise work 
12v usb car charger isn't recognised

Non Dell headsets are ignored. 

==============================================
Lots of other things
