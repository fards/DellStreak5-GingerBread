This is a kernel for the Dell Streak 5 based on Alpha Code released by Dell at opensource.dell.com subsequently removed without explanation. 


The kernel builds and boots and is stable enough for everyday use but there are several issues with it in its current state, that need workarounds or fixing. 

The Initial Commit is NOT how the code came, 
there are several codefixes, tweaks and experiments already enabled. 


****THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS**** and will be updated regularily

======================================

CURRENT ISSUES

PowerManager is having issues with wakelock (it won't recover from idle)

work around is to echo 1 > sys/power/wake_lock


Sensors dont work at userspace level *******FIXED PARTIALLY
the kernel uses "Sensors_daemon" a mid layer that messes with the HAL that we don't have code for. 
At low level the sensors work

voice is picked up by mic on first outgoing call after boot, fine on incoming,
but does otherwise work. workaround is to call voicemail first. 


12v usb car charger isn't recognised ******** FIXED 

Non Dell headsets are ignored. 
Lots of other things

==============================================

*******FIXED*****************
(MANY THANKS TO AWDMANIAC) 

12v (car) charger now charges properly

********UPDATE******* AUGUST 4 2011 
Ecompass and gsensor now work at userspace.
and include code based on the work of alankila here 

http://www.bel.fi/~alankila/Junk.git/akmd/ 
it needs a new module and libsensors building into the userspace.

Build instructions. 

Get AOSP code from Android git
following the instructions here. 
http://source.android.com/source/index.html

after the repo has finished. 
cd to the ANDROID_BUILD_DIRECTORY you created that has your source code in it

mkdir kernel
cd kernel
git clone this kernel to that directory (or download it manually) 
make sure the files are in the correct folder ANDROID_BUILD_DIRECTORY/kernel

export PATH=$PATH:~/ANDROID_BUILD_DIRECTORY/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin
export CROSS_COMPILE=arm-eabi-
export ARCH=arm
cp rename_to_.config .config
make menuconfig 
make -j8

if there's errors correct them 
make clean 
make -j8

if theres no errors you need to extract a ramdisk and mkbootimg based on that to create a valid boot.img
