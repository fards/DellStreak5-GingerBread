This is a kernel for the Dell Streak 5 based on Alpha Code released by Dell at opensource.dell.com subsequently removed without explanation. 


The kernel builds and boots and is stable enough for everyday use but there are several issues with it in its current state, that need workarounds or fixing. 

The Initial Commit is NOT how the code came, there are several codefixes and tweaks already enabled. 

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS, and will be updated regularily

CURRENT ISSUES

PowerManager is having issues with wakelock 
work around is to echo 1 > sys/power/wake_lock

Sensors dont work at userspace level 
the kernel uses "Sensors_daemon" a mid layer that messes with teh HAL. 
At low level the sensors work

Lots of other things
