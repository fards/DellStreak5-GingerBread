 * Declaring packed structures is compiler specific. In order to handle all
 * cases, packed structures should be delared as:
 *
 * #include <packed_section_start.h>
 *
 * typedef BWL_PRE_PACKED_STRUCT struct foobar_t {
 *    some_struct_members;
 * } BWL_POST_PACKED_STRUCT foobar_t;
 *
 * #include <packed_section_end.h>
